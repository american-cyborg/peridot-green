Description: Computer-manipulated photograph. The base photograph is a woman using her smartphone. She has glasses, long dark hair, and a long dark dress with a v-neck. The artist's manipulation of the photograph gives her image a deep blue sweeping echo, with purple and green beams curve out from her hand.

Story: Robin purchased this from American Cyborg's Peridot Green in New York, NY. It is part of the artist's Radiant Slug series, where he manipulates photographs of people using their smartphones in public in New York City. It was part of the Peridot Green's Spring 2015 salon, PGII: Pocket Monsters.
